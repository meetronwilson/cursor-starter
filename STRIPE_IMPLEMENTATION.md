# Stripe Implementation Progress

## Completed Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Verified that all required Stripe environment variables are set up in `.env.local`
   - Created a guide for setting up Stripe CLI for local webhook testing in `STRIPE_SETUP.md`

2. **Checkout Flow Implementation**
   - Created a `CheckoutButton` component for initiating Stripe checkout
   - Updated the pricing plans component to include Stripe price IDs
   - Updated the pricing card component to use the checkout button for paid plans
   - Added success and cancel message components for the pricing page
   - Updated the billing page to handle the success query parameter

## Next Steps

1. **Stripe Dashboard Configuration**
   - Create products and prices in the Stripe dashboard that match our pricing tiers
   - Configure metadata for features and other product details
   - Set up webhook endpoints

2. **Subscription Management**
   - Implement subscription upgrade/downgrade functionality
   - Add subscription cancellation with confirmation

3. **Testing**
   - Test the entire subscription flow in test mode
   - Verify webhook handling works correctly
   - Test subscription lifecycle events (creation, updates, cancellation)

## How to Test the Current Implementation

1. Start your Next.js application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the Stripe CLI webhook forwarding:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

3. Navigate to the pricing page and click on a subscription button
4. Complete the checkout process in the Stripe checkout page
5. Verify that you are redirected back to the application with a success message
6. Check the billing page to see your active subscription

## Known Issues and Limitations

- The current implementation uses placeholder Stripe price IDs in the fallback pricing tiers
- The subscription management UI needs to be completed
- Webhook handling needs to be tested with various subscription events
